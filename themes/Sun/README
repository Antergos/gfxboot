See bootloader-src-SLES-8.1 for png images src and how to configure them.

this code was originally taken from SuSE boot theme package and it was then
modified a good bit ;)

*.inc contain the pseudo postscript code for the grub menu and the boot
splash image.

to compile everything as root do: make

two directories are created :
- boot, holds all the files needed for the splash and grub menu 
  to be installed (in bootloader theme directory or in /boot)
  
- install, holds all the files needed for the boot CD splash and grub menu


see /usr/share/doc/packages/gfxboot/README in the gfxboot rpm for a description
of the language.
