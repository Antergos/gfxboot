</h3>

<p>
The included <em>메모리 테스트</em> provides good possibilities to
stress test the hardware of a system. Its main purpose is to detect
broken RAM, but it also stresses many other parts of the system.

<p>
There is no guarantee that the memory is good if no errors are
found, although most of memory defects will be found.
